### Key list

1. **Thread**
2. **Global execution context**
3. **Function Execution context**
4. **CallStack**

#### Thread

- javascript is a single threaded
- Execution is done line by line

### Global execution context (GEC)

- This is the default execution context in which JS code start its execution when the file first loads in the browser.
- All of the global code  i.e. code which is not inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.
- Only one GEC because JS engine is single threaded.

### Function Execution context (FEC)

- Every time a function is invoked(called), a brand new execution context is created for that function.
- Each function has its own execution context, but it’s created when the function is invoked or called.
- There can be any number of function execution contexts. Whenever a new execution context is created,

### CallStack

- The one which keeps track of the function call's
- GEC is the at the bottom of the CallStack
- when new FEC is created it pushes on top of the CallStack will learn more about CallStack with eg below.

#### Let’s understand **How Function works in javascript**

```js
function multiplyTwo(number) {
  let result = number * 2;
  return result;
}
function multiplyThree(number) {
  let result = number * 3;
  return result;
}
console.log(multiplyTwo(5));
console.log(multiplyThree(6));
```

```js
let a = 'Hello World!';
function second() {
  console.log('Inside second function');
}
function first() {
  console.log('Inside first function');
  second();
  console.log('Again inside first function');
}
first();
console.log('Inside Global Execution Context');
```
